# Agents.md — Guidance for AI-assisted Development
_An overview of the current repository and its related projects, generated by [AgentPrimer](https://github.com/deanthecoder/AgentPrimer)._
## Summary for Agents
Use this overview as factual context when generating or editing code.  
Avoid unnecessary token use; prefer referencing this document instead of re-parsing source files.
## Agent Instructions (Overview)
- Read this report top-to-bottom to understand the repository structure, technologies, and conventions.
- Look for **Agent note** callouts embedded in specific sections; they contain targeted guidance.
- Keep context usage lean: prefer summaries and interfaces over ingesting full source files.
- Match the English style as reported below.
- Prefer existing frameworks, tests, and naming conventions shown here.
- Check Supported UI Languages when adding UI strings so required translations stay in sync.
- Use the `ripgrep` tool for efficient code searching, if available.
## Repositories (5)
> **Agent note:** Sub-modules and sibling repositories often expose reusable libraries (e.g., extension methods, utilities). Cross-reference these before re-implementing.

## NuGet (18)
> **Agent note:** Prefer solutions using the listed packages and frameworks; avoid introducing new technologies without justification.

* `Avalonia               ` : Avalonia is a cross-platform UI framework for .NET providing a flexible styling system and supporting a wide range of Operating Systems such as Windows, Linux, macOS and with experimental support for Android, iOS and WebAssembly.
* `coverlet.collector     ` : Coverlet is a cross platform code coverage library for .NET, with support for line, branch and method coverage.
* `DialogHost.Avalonia    ` : Avalonia Dialog Host control that provides a simple way to display a dialog with information or prompt the user when information is required
* `DotnetNoise            ` : FastNoise is an open source noise generation library with a large collection of different noise algorithms. This library has been designed for realtime usage from the ground up, so has been optimised for speed without sacrificing noise quality.
* `JetBrains.Annotations  ` : JetBrains.Annotations help reduce false positive warnings, explicitly declare purity and nullability in your code, deal with implicit usages of members, support special semantics of APIs in ASP.NET and XAML frameworks and otherwise increase accuracy of JetBrains Rider and ReSharper code inspections.
* `K4os.Compression.LZ4   ` : Port of LZ4 compression algorithm for .NET
* `Markdig                ` : A fast, powerful, CommonMark compliant, extensible Markdown processor for .NET with 20+ builtin extensions (pipetables, footnotes, definition lists... etc.)
* `Material.Avalonia      ` : This repository is a set of styles that will help you customize your application in an appropriate material design.
* `Material.Icons.Avalonia` : Avalonia control for display material icons from Material.Icons
